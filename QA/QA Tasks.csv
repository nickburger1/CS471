- Fixed the UpdateDemographicsInfo. This was VERY redundant code. I imagine it got messed up in a merge
**Other Random changes**
- Changed the error message when saving on Volunteer General & Demographics to include dropdowns with no error message provided _(the border turns red, but because there was no value, it does not show the text)_

- fixed a bug that caused the cancel prompt to show every time you try to exit AddVolunteer even if no changes were made to the page. This causes all dropdowns (except state) to have no selection instead of defaulting to the first option.

3. Edit
4. Change the weekdays at the bottom right
5. Save
6. Select the same school

Changing any volunteers demographic info is not persisting after closing out of the application and relaunching. Oddly, hitting refresh info does not make the new changes go away, but only when the application is closed and reopened.

There is inconsistent capitalization for tooltips for the buttons on some pages:
      -  All Schools (Add New School, Edit School, Export All Schools to Excel buttons)
      - Finance General (Edit Cost Share, Export to Excel, Edit In-Kind Expense buttons)
      - Meals and Transport (Edit button)
 The rest of the system has each word in the tooltip capitalized, so to keep consistency throughout the system, all the tooltips should have the same capitalization. 

There is also some inconsistent wording for some of the tooltips:
      - Activity Log- the add, edit, and delete do not match the other tooltip buttons in the system do
      - Reports Volunteer Info - the edit and export buttons again do not match the other edit/export buttons in the system.
      - Per School tab- The export button should say ""Export to Excel"" instead of ""Save to Excel"" to match other export buttons.

Volunteer should be able to utilize leftover PTO time based on PTO Earned+Start. The user cannot enter a number greater than this. 
- Major functionality change: PTO Eligibility. Before, setting Eligible -> Not Eligible would remove all PTO Eligibility and PTO Used up until the current month and year. After reviewing the Capstone Excel PtoStipend sheet, this may not be the direction the system wants to go. Based on the Excel sheets, some volunteers may be eligible for only a single month or vice versa. To counter this, setting Eligible -> Ineligible will set all future records to not eligible. And keep the eligibility status and PTO used for all the previous months. Setting Ineligible -> Eligible will function similarly. 
- Due to this change, PTO Start and End will be adjusted throughout the year if any changes in eligibility occur. If the volunteer is ineligible for PTO, they cannot accrue any PTO time. However, they can still use PTO time earned from PREVIOUS months when they were eligible. "

Something to think about: 

I am unable to figure out a way on the system to update a volunteers name. What happens if a volunteer gets married and their last name changes or if a volunteer legally changes their name?

Even after I change my user level from admin to non-admin while logged in as an admin, I am still able to access the Users Tab. The system should have logged me out upon saving the user-level changes.

2. Go to the Users tab
3. Click on the username you logged in with
4. Click edit
5. Uncheck the user level (make is non admin)
6. Save setting

The system should either log out showing a message that the user does not have access to the tab and needs to login again or just hide the Users tab.

Whenever I add a new billing for the finance general page. And save it, it defaults to last year available. ( in this case 2029-2030). Which is annoying if you're trying to add billing for lets say the whole year.

PTO Calculations appear to be pulling data from the wrong field and PTO earned is not carrying over to the next month.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

- Fill in hours earned for 3 months, my data throughout these three months:

<img width=""843"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71031668/231231295-5e29a4d4-d947-4836-9eb4-8608cb804f68.png"">

- So, since we are PTO eligible since march. And we have accumulated PTO hours, we should be able to use these hours from previous months and not work this month, but we can't since PTO earned is 0:

<img width=""838"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71031668/231232312-5c18c704-63a4-4498-8663-e8b227e22d3e.png"">



### Expected Result

I should be able to use PTO accumulated over the past months.

### Actual Result

I can't use this PTO since it appears that the PTO earned is only used to calculate PTO earned from this month, and then this data is used to calculate PTO.

### Relevant log output

_No response_

### Environment

_No response_

### Additional Information

I think that the whole lay-out might be confusing. The PTO ended is how much PTO you ended with last month, so isn't that PTO earned? I think we can just use PTO Accumulated (for pto earned YTD), PTO earned this month, and PTO used. This should also simplify the calculations."

- First of I think the school should be defaulted to a school where there is data for.
- Secondly, I can't seem to save changes or add anything no matter what I do, and it does not provide me with any errors of what I am doing wrong.
- It also allows for invalid information when editing the time, like for example no end-time:
<img width=""825"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71031668/231223289-6f419392-04ec-4946-b4bc-1aa4bc168a9a.png"">


### Steps to reproduce the issue

What I did:
- Add a new classroom assignment for a volunteer, with correct data:
<img width=""234"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71031668/231221827-9f05e6a1-f8ec-4952-9197-76fabb34b6d7.png"">
- Then when we save it, sometime works, sometimes it doesn't, but either way it does not show up in the list. Until we restart the application, it does not work when we ""refresh"".
- Next when we use one field with invalid information, it refuses to save without any errors, so I don't know what I am doing wrong.



### Expected Result

When saving a volunteer with correct data, I expect a notification for success like with the other pages, and it should show up immediately in the list.

When I input wrong information I expect to be notified of that , instead of just not allowing me to save.

### Actual Result

The system freezes after clicking on the ""refresh data"" button several times. This leads to the system becoming unresponsive to any further input, which leads to the user not being able to interact with the system until the data is refreshed for all clicks.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

1. Go to any tabs other than Home
2. Click refresh several time

### Expected Result

When following the steps, I expected the system to refresh the data each time the button was clicked without any issues. The user should be able to view updated data without any interruption.

### Actual Result

When I followed the steps, the system froze after clicking the ""refresh data"" button several times. This prevented the user from accessing any other features of the system until it was refreshed.

**Current Bugs**
- The persistence is not implemented on ChildAssignments due to ongoing work on the page. I have let @ChristopherWashburn know about this and gave him the code to add once he merges this PR with his own branch. 
- ActivityLog can change the selected volunteer for other pages, but not the other way around. Example of this: Selecting a volunteer on Activity Log will update General, Demographics, and Financials. Selecting a volunteer on any page will NOT update the selection on Activity Log. The issue stems from the combobox.SelectedIndex being reset to null (-1), but I do not understand why this is happening. My only guess is that the binding is set to an object and not a nullable int. I sent @T-Moody a message about this to get his input. 

**Other Minor Changes**
- changed the styling of the volunteer combobox on volunteer demographics to match every other page
- added the option to clear the combobox selection
- added a null check in PopulateVolunteerInfo on volunteer demographics because it kept crashing if the selection was cleared on any other page"

Essentially, I accidently removed the UI update method call on my last pull request for the Refresh button.  A large amount of the issues that were occurring was due to this removal. My apologies for testing a broken page without that method call. 

Regarding the Refresh button functionality, the data is meant to get updated every time the user 'Saves' their changes. The Refresh button is strictly for any volunteer changes made outside of the page. Hitting this button won't do any calculations, unless I am mistaken on the purpose of this button. 

**- Issue 1: Inputting a valid number, and then pressing enter what a normal workflow would look like it says invalid number..**
	- Unsure how to tackle this issue since 'Enter' would have to correspond to a button on the screen. There is a property call for this but it's unable to save the current data context. I'll keep working on this, but for right now, it won't display any errors. 
**- Issue 2: We then try to add some valid hours with a volunteer and it won't let me, since I didn't fill out all the information. Which should just default to 0 like they are displayed before editing. So that way I can simply add hours.**
	- Biggest change to the page is that if no financial record exists, e.g. none for November 2023, a record will be immediately added and pushed to the database. As well as the page will update it's PTO Start, End and YTD. Before, the page displayed 0's as an indicator no record is found and made the page really confusing. That was an oversight on my end. 
**- Issue 3: Then when adding valid numbers, upon leaving the text box the border is still red, making me think that I input invalid numbers**
	- Changed in which a valid keystroke will remove the red border. An invalid keystroke will display red. 
**- Issue 4: Then when we have inputted valid info, it doesn't update any of the calculated values.**
	- That's my mistake. I accidently got rid of my UI update call.
**- Issue 5: Nor is this valid data persisted to the next month.**
	- It should be persisting now. 
**- Issue 6: Then when editing the hours back to 0, nothing gets recalculated, like the YTD hours and PTO earned, which is 60, when I only worked 40 hours?**
	- Due to my mistake as before. The data was getting changed in the DB but I accidently removed the UI update call. 
**- Issue 7: Then when I reload the volunteer page it doesn't update, but this data should be updated when I save the updates.**
	- The Reload/Refresh button is only for outside volunteer changes for the page. Like, volunteer was added or deleted. 
**- Issue 8: Also I am not sure why I earned 60 PTO hours when I worked 40, and then this calculated data is not persisted throughout other months**
	- The volunteer worked 40 regular hours and the PTO rate is currently 1.5. That equites to 60 PTO earned. The only fix I can think of for this is not to allow the PTO Earned to exceed the regular hours worked. 
**- Issue 9: Also while using the PTO, the start and end for PTO are automatically populated, but this also decreases the amount of PTO used, so we lose pto while not redeeming it?**
	- PTO earned and used are month-to-month values, and do not accrue over time. PTO start and end represent any form of rollback values. PTO used may be decreasing due to the PTO earned getting changed. This only occurs if the used exceeds the amount earned. A volunteer should never be able to use more PTO hours than they have currently earned."

https://api.github.com/repos/CSCapstone23/Capstone-FGMS/issues/330,330,[Bug]: Finance / FY and GY tabs - System Crashed while changing date range multiple times,@{login=rakibulll,closed,@{login=T-Moody,2,2023-04-05T15:07:41Z,2023-04-11T14:57:19Z,2023-04-11T14:57:18Z,"### What happened?

It appears that the system crashed and froze while changing the date range multiple times. As for what was expected to happen, the application should have been able to handle the user's request to change the date range without any issues, and the system should have continued to function normally. However, it seems that the application was unable to handle the multiple requests, causing it to crash and freeze.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

### To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Finance tab in the application.
2. Select the Fiscal Year/Grant Year tab.
3. Click on the ""Select Grant Date Range"" option.
4. Choose any start and end date range.
5. Repeat steps 4 multiple times, selecting different date ranges.

After repeating these steps, the application may encounter issues such as slowing down or becoming unresponsive, or it may crash or freeze altogether.

It's important to note that the issue may not occur every time the steps are repeated, and it may depend on factors such as the amount of data being entered, the performance of the server, or other variables. Therefore, it may be necessary to repeat the steps multiple times to observe the issue consistently.

### Expected Result

When following the steps to select a grant date range in the Finance tab of the application, I would expect the system to apply the filter and display the corresponding financial data for the selected date range.

I would also expect the system to handle multiple requests to select different date ranges without encountering any issues, such as slow response times, crashes, or freezes. The application should be able to process the user's requests smoothly and efficiently, allowing the user to filter the data as needed to perform their tasks.

### Actual Result

When following the steps to select a grant date range in the Finance tab of the application, the system encountered issues such as slow response times, crashes, or freezes.

- Changed the title of the main window to ""Grandparent Education Management System (GEM)"" instead of ""Main Window""

**Volunteer General Fixes**
- Rewrote DB calls to include saving the school selection (including if a school was not previously selected)
- Allows a school to be unselected and will mark assignment for deletion
- If the user selects the same school, the record will be reenabled (isDeleted = false)
- Fixed DB calls not saving Annuals checks if there were no annual checks yet"

After inputting blank user input in the edit mode and attempting to save it, the application completely crashes.

### Steps to reproduce the issue

- Open the application and navigate to the ""Volunteers"" tab and then navigate the ""General"" tab.
- Click on the ""Edit"" button to make changes to the information.
- Leave the ""Volunteer Name"" field blank.
- Make any other desired changes to the information.
- Click on the ""Save"" button to save the changes.
- The application crashes and an error message appears.to 

### Expected Result

If the ""Volunteer Name"" field is left blank when attempting to save changes in the ""General"" tab, the application should display an alert or warning message stating that the field is required and cannot be left empty. The user should be prompted to enter a volunteer name before they can successfully save the changes. This would prevent the application from crashing and provide a better user experience.

### Actual Result

When attempting to save changes in the ""General"" tab without selecting a volunteer name, the application encounters a System.NullReferenceException error. The error message states that an object reference was not set to an instance of an object. The error occurs in the VolunteerGeneral.xaml.cs file at line 60, specifically in the btnFinish_Click() method. This means that there is a programming error in the code that is causing the application to crash.

### Relevant log output

```shell

The functionality of updating the status of a volunteer on the volunteer general page, is not useable. Unless you specifically type ""No"" or ""Yes"" for the status, it will just revert back to the previous status upon restart of the app. So, it won't let you know that you are wrong either it will just delete all your work. 

**You also can't revert an inactive volunteer back to active**

### Steps to reproduce the issue

Enter ""no"" ""nO"", ""yes"" or anything other than capital first letter, ""Yes"" or ""No"".

### Expected Result

The idea is that you can pick between two states yes or no, not manually type this. And this should be persisted.

### Actual Result

Unless it is ""Yes"" or ""No"" exactly, it will display your input but not actually persist it. It doesn't give any indication of what you are doing wrong. And I should be able to make inactive volunteers active again.

Things I have done:
- Nate and I updated some structure for Volunteers and their foreign relations
- Added dependency injection and modified UI page models to include the ServiceProvider (**ALL FRONTEND PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING THIS ON NEW PAGES**). This is how the UI will talk to the Business layer (service layer).
- Fixed my typo in the BusinessLogic namespace (my bad)
- Added connection to new central Azure database
