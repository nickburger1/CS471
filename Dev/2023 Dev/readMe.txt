You will have to uninstall any prior version of the app before you can install a newer version.

v1.0.1
Fixed multiple bugs/mistakes
 - most notable fix is that in-kind expenses added from the finance general page will be viewable on that page. You may first need to add an expense type from the Admin tasks page, and then add an expense of that type on
	finance general page. After save is hit from the add dialog you should see an option show up in the year range for the in kind expense table at the bottom of the finance general page.
 - an error no longer gets thrown when a volunteer is made inactive without a separation date.
 - The home page graph now updates with new schools and volunteers and changes to either's status/ assignment. If the graph does not update when a particular change is made a refresh button is now present on the page.


Known missing features/ functionality

- Database concurrency control
- nothing else was knowingly missed, but child assignments could be made simpler
